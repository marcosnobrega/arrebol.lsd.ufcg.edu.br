Installing Arrebol

------

After unpacking a Arrebol release package (listed here), the Arrebol CLI script can be found in bin/directory.

##How to configure the Arrebol CLI?
To configure the Arrebol CLI, simply assign the address of the Submission Service to the host property in the bin/arrebol.properties configuration file:
host=http://ip:port


##How to configure the Submission Service?
To configure the Submission Service one should edit two configuration files. In the first file, arrebol.conf, it is mandatory to assign the port which the Submission Service daemon will wait for HTTP requests after it has been started:
rest_server_port=port


In the second file, sched.conf, it is possible to tune the behaviour of the Submission Service. We cover this configuration in the full tutorial.
To start the Submission Service, run the script:
bash bin/start-arrebol-service
